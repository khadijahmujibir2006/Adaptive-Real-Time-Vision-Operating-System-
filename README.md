# Adaptive Real-Time Vision Operating System (ARVOS)

##  Overview
Adaptive Real-Time Vision Operating System (ARVOS) is a **Computer Science core project** that integrates **Operating Systems principles** with **Computer Vision** to design an adaptive, real-time vision framework.

Unlike conventional computer vision pipelines that execute all vision algorithms continuously, ARVOS dynamically schedules vision tasks based on **scene complexity, system resource usage, and FPS constraints**, similar to how an operating system schedules processes.

---

##  Problem Statement
Real-time computer vision systems commonly face the following challenges:
- High CPU utilization
- Reduced frame rate (FPS)
- Inefficient use of computational resources
- Static execution of vision algorithms regardless of scene conditions

These issues reduce performance and scalability, especially in real-time environments.

---

##  Proposed Solution
ARVOS introduces an **OS-inspired scheduling approach** to computer vision.

Vision tasks such as **object detection** and **object tracking** are treated as **operating system processes**.  
A scheduler dynamically decides:
- Which vision task should execute
- When the task should execute
- When tasks should be delayed or skipped

This adaptive behavior ensures **efficient resource utilization** while maintaining **real-time performance**.
